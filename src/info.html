            <h4>Hi, my name is Syd (he/they), nice that you want to know more.</h4>
           <p>
To start off, I am a 20-year-old electronic producer and artist. 
My songs are about my queer and trans experience, and delve into my emotions. 
I started producing music in 2019; before this, I followed a pre-course study in performance arts: jazz and pop singing at ArtEZ. 
I also took ensemble and piano courses. I am now taking lessons to learn classical singing techniques. 
My in-the-box experience includes: Logic Pro X, JavaScript/HTML, RekordBox, Ableton Live 11, Max MSP, and SuperCollider. 
I am also familiar with live audio and recording, but I am majoring in composing and producing. 
Currently, I am studying at the University of the Arts Utrecht (HKU), in the music and technology department.
I would love to connect, send me a mail or message â™¡.
